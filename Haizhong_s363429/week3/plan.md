2-Week, 20-Hour Per Week Plan
Week 1

Days 1-2: Programming Languages
Goal: Learn the basics of a programming language (e.g., Python).
Activity: Complete the first two sections of an online tutorial or course.
Resources: Codecademy, Coursera, or Udemy Python beginner courses.

Days 3-4: Data Structures and Algorithms
Goal: Learn basic data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching).
Activity: Complete relevant online tutorials or video courses.
Resources: LeetCode, HackerRank, or Khan Academy data structures and algorithms courses.

Days 5-6: Version Control Systems
Goal: Learn how to use Git for version control.
Activity: Install Git and learn basic commands (e.g., clone, commit, push, pull).
Resources: Pro Git book or Git official documentation.

Day 7: Review and Practice
Goal: Review what you’ve learned during the week and practice coding.
Activity: Solve problems on LeetCode and manage a small project using Git.

Week 2
Days 8-9: Database Management and SQL
Goal: Learn basic SQL queries and database design.
Activity: Complete SQL tutorials and learn how to create, read, update, and delete data.
Resources: Khan Academy SQL course or W3Schools SQL tutorial.

Days 10-11: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Methodologies
Goal: Understand different software development methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall).
Activity: Read articles or tutorials about SDLC.
Resources: Scrum Guide or “Agile Estimating and Planning” book.

Days 12-13: Debugging and Testing Skills
Goal: Learn basic debugging techniques and testing methods.
Activity: Use debugging tools (e.g., PyCharm debugger) and learn to write and execute unit tests.
Resources: Online tutorials about debugging and unit testing.

Days 14: Software Architecture Design
Goal: Understand basic software architecture concepts (e.g., MVC pattern).
Activity: Read articles or tutorials about software architecture design.
Resources: Design patterns books or online courses.

Days 15-16: Operating Systems and Networking Basics
Goal: Learn the basics of operating systems and networking.
Activity: Complete online courses or tutorials.
Resources: Coursera or edX courses on operating systems and networking.

Days 17-20: Integrated Practice
Goal: Apply the skills you’ve learned by working on a small project.
Activity: Create a simple application or tool using the skills acquired (e.g., programming language, database, version control).
Resources: Host the project on GitHub and refer to tutorials or documentation to solve real-world problems.
